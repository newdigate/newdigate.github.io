# Preface
Arduino and teensy micro-controller communities are thriving. Arduino platform has many great libraries, reference designs and forums. 

Arduino has opened up a portal into the universe of electronics for myself and millions of students, enthusiasts and professionals alike. Before I started experimenting with Arduino, my practical knowledge about electronics was thin. Arduino provided a platform for me to learn - I find it very adictive - interfacing shields / sensors / displays / sound cards. There is always a "next step"... I have become an electronics enthusiast. By day job, Im a software developer, mainly writing c# distributed systems, and writing low level c and c++ code has helped me understand and appreciate mechanical sympathy (largely order-of-magnitude)
