# Preface
## Arduino
Arduino has opened up a portal into the universe of electronics for myself and millions of others - students, enthusiasts and professionals alike. Arduino and teensy micro-controller communities are thriving. Arduino platform has many great libraries, examples, reference designs, topics and forums. 

Before I started experimenting with arduino, my practical knowledge about electronics was thin. Arduino provided a platform for me to learn - which I find very adictive - interfacing shields / sensors / displays / sound cards. 

As I am a musician, my approach is to build audio and midi devices.
## Teensy
I started tinkering with teensy microcontroller boards about 2 years ago. It has been a great learning journey. I have found the teensy devices to be perfect for my needs. I love digital signal processing and analysis, digital displays, audio codecs. 

# Philosophy
## Ubuntu
### I am, because we are
This project is only possible because of the brilliant contribution of hard work made freely available by generous people in the ardiuno and teensy community. 

## Respect and thanks
### PJRC
The PJRC team have pioneered the teensy microcontroller range of microcontroller boards and lead the integration between arduino and 32bit cortex microcontrollers, and have contributed and facilited many amazing libraries for the arduino landscape
