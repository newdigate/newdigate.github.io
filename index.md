# The journey so far
My initial ambition was to use teensy as an audio processor. I was thinking of using a guitar stomp-pedal form factor. 

The problem facing me was that my teensy micro-controller projects were becoming out-of-control, with too many jumper wires, jack-connectors, and rotary encoders to and from headers plugged into breadboards. This approach was tedium ad neuseam, a delicate mesh of inter-connected wires routed in such a way as to make space for the pots and stomp switch and teensy pcb.
