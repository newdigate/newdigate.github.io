# DIY teensy eurorack
[introduction & acknowledgements](introduction "intro")

# The journey so far
My ambition in 2016 was to use teensy 3.2 micro-controller board with a sound-card as a digital audio processor, mainly for guitar audio. It was not long before I started facing challenges and learning curves; During this time I have really enjoyed and appreciated the arduino and teensy micro-controllers communities;

# Eurorack (form factor)
Initially, I was thinking of using a guitar stomp-pedal form factor; this didn't really work so well because there were too many wires to jack-connectors, rotary encoders and pin-headers.

So I adopted the eurorack form factor for convenience. My friend Ray took me to a Eurorack modular exhibition in London. On the whole I was very much insprired by the modular movement but parts of which either annoy me or intruig me.
