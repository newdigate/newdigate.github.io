# DIY teensy eurorack
[introduction](introduction "intro")

# The journey so far
My initial ambition was to use teensy as a digital audio processor, mainly for guitar audio. I made lots of progress and really enjoyed working with the teensy microcontrollers. 

The problem was that too many wires were quickly becoming out-of-control; wires to jack-connectors, rotary encoders and pin-headers became a delicate mesh of inter-connected wires routed tediusly.

# Eurorack (form factor)
Initially, I was thinking of using a guitar stomp-pedal form factor. 
I have adopted the eurorack form factor for convenience.
