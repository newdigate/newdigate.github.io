# Preface
Arduino has opened up a portal into the universe of electronics for myself and millions of others - students, enthusiasts and professionals alike. Arduino and teensy micro-controller communities are thriving. Arduino platform has many great libraries, examples, reference designs, topics and forums. 

Before I started experimenting with arduino, my practical knowledge about electronics was thin. Arduino provided a platform for me to learn - which I find very adictive - interfacing shields / sensors / displays / sound cards. 

As I am a musician, my approach is to build audio and midi devices.
